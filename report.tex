\section{Introduction}

\section{Regression}
The role of regression is to generate a model, which represents the realtionship between the given data's independant variable and depent variable. 

In order to accurately predict the model the error (also known as residual) between the given data and the predicted data is minimised (The predicted data, is that given by the model). In this coursework the error is caulated using a square error, in order to prevent negative and positive errors from cancelling each other out. The formula for this is as follows: 

\begin{equation}
  \Sigma (y - \hat{y})^2
\end {equation}

where \(y\), is the given data, and \(\hat{y}\) is the predicted data calculated by the estimated model.

\section{Results}

I this coursework I implemented 3 possible funciton types: exponential, polynomial and sinusoidal.
